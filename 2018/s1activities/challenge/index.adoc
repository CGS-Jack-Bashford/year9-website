== Challenge One: Shapes ==

image::challenge1.jpg[Challenge 1, link="challenge1.jpg"]

Your task is "simple" - re-create what you see in the screenshot above using only HTML and CSS. No images are allowed!. This only needs to work in Chrome.

Googling "drawing css shapes" is also a good starting point for more information.

Your HTML needs to validate, but your CSS does not.

== Challenge Two: Animation ==

Create the following animation using purely HTML and CSS.

image::challenge2.gif[Challenge 2, link="challenge2.gif"]

For information, this has been done using CSS keyframes (which you may like to research).

The starting colour of the box is `#92B901` and the end colour of the box is `#1ec7e6`. The keyframe animation handles the transition between the colours.

Your HTML needs to validate, but your CSS does not.

== Challenge Three: Text ==

Create the following animation using purely HTML and CSS.

Can you do this - I'm talking about the text with the thin line behind the text? You need to follow the restrictions below:

* *Only one single h1 element is allowed in the body element of the page - no other tags are permitted*
* The `h1` text is horizontally centred in its parent `body` element
* The line is vertically centred on the text
* Both the font size and the text have to be editable without having to edit the line
* No images and no JavaScript are allowed
* Your HTML needs to validate, but your CSS does not.

*Note: While this activity looks easy, when you consider the restrictions above it is actually quite tricky. Good luck!*
